    <p>My time at WebstaurantStore has been an incredible journey of growth and learning, where I’ve immersed myself in the world of quality assurance automation. From the very beginning, I was drawn to the challenge of ensuring that every line of code deployed into production was reliable and bug-free. As a QA Automation Intern, I’ve been fortunate to work alongside some of the most talented professionals in the industry, who’ve not only mentored me but also pushed me to sharpen my skills in test automation frameworks and best practices. The collaborative environment at WebstaurantStore fostered a culture of innovation and continuous improvement, making every day an opportunity to learn something new and refine my approach to testing.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of my internship was the opportunity to work on a high-impact project that involved automating end-to-end testing for a critical piece of the company’s e-commerce platform. This project was a deep dive into tools like Selenium and JUnit, where I built and maintained test scripts that simulated user interactions across different browsers and devices. The real challenge was ensuring that these tests were both comprehensive and maintainable, a task that required not only technical expertise but also a strong understanding of the business logic behind the application. Seeing the results of my work reflected in smoother deployments and fewer post-release issues was immensely rewarding, and it reinforced my passion for quality assurance.</p>

<p>Beyond the technical aspects, my time at WebstaurantStore has also been about building relationships and understanding the broader impact of my work. I learned the importance of communication between development and QA teams and how critical it is to have a shared understanding of project goals. This experience taught me to be more proactive in seeking feedback and to view every challenge as an opportunity to grow. As I look back on my internship, I’m grateful for the skills I’ve acquired and the connections I’ve made, all of which have prepared me to take on even bigger challenges in the future.</p>
